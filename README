NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::Util - Utility routines related to Perinci::CmdLine

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of Perinci::CmdLine::Util (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-Util), released on 2014-11-01.

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  detect_perinci_cmdline_script(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Detect whether a file is a Perinci::CmdLine-based CLI script.

    The criteria are:

    *   the file must exist and readable;

    *   (optional, if "include_noexec" is false) file must have its
        executable mode bit set;

    *   content must start with a shebang "#!";

    *   either: must be perl script (shebang line contains 'perl') and must
        contain something like "use Perinci::CmdLine";

    *   or: a script tagged as a wrapper script and the wrapped script is a
        Perinci::CmdLine script.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   include_backup => *bool* (default: 0)

        Include backup files.

    *   include_noexec => *bool* (default: 1)

        Include scripts that do not have +x mode bit set.

    *   include_wrapper => *bool* (default: 0)

        Include wrapper scripts.

        A wrapper script is another Perl script, a shell script, or some
        other script which wraps a Perinci::CmdLine script. For example, if
        "list-id-holidays" is a Perinci::CmdLine script, then this shell
        script called "list-id-joint-leaves" is a wrapper:

         #!/bin/bash
         list-id-holidays --is-holiday=0 --is-joint-leave=0 "$@"

        It makes sense to provide the same completion for this wrapper
        script as "list-id-holidays".

        To help this function detect such script, you need to put a tag
        inside the file:

         #!/bin/bash
         # TAG wrapped=list-id-holidays
         list-id-holidays --is-holiday=0 --is-joint-leave=0 "$@"

        If this option is enabled, these scripts will be included.

    *   script* => *any*

        Path to file to be checked.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)
