DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  detect_perinci_cmdline_script(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Detect whether a file is a Perinci::CmdLine-based CLI script.

    The criteria are:

    *   the file must exist and readable;

    *   (optional, turned on by "filter_x") file must have its executable
        mode bit set;

    *   content must start with a shebang "#!";

    *   content must contain something like "use Perinci::CmdLine";

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filter_x => *bool*

        If on, only consider script that has +x mode bit set.

    *   script* => *any*

        Path to file to be checked.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.
